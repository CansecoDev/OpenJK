### Vulkan support
Credits to JKSunny:<br />
Support Initially started by porting to [Quake-III-Arena-Kenny-Edition](https://github.com/kennyalive/Quake-III-Arena-Kenny-Edition).<br />
After that, [vkQuake3](https://github.com/suijingfeng/vkQuake3/tree/master/code), hence the file structure.

Lastly, [Quake3e](https://github.com/ec-/Quake3e).<br />
Which is highly maintained, and is packed with many additions compared to the other repositories.

Therefore the vulkan renderer is now based on Quake3e. <br />A list of the additions can be found on [here](https://github.com/ec-/Quake3e#user-content-vulkan-renderer).

Many thanks to all the contributors that worked & are still working hard on improving the Q3 engine!
